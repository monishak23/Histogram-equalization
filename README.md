# Histogram-equalisation

Abstract:

To implement histogram equalization using C++ where the input would be an image 

and output should be linear filtered image.

Working:

The original image is first read.

Then histogram value is calculated for that image.

Using that calculated value , the histogram is plotted for the original value.

Then the original image is cloned to equalize.

Weighed histogram and cumulative histogram is calculated to equalize the image.

Then the histogram is calculated and plotted .

Finally the histogram equalized image and plotted histogram of that image is display.
